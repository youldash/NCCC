<img src="https://raw.github.com/youldash/NCCC/master/UQU-LOGO-1024x731.png" width="100%" />

Welcome to the NCCC training repository! This repository is dedicated to the CIS teams (both female and male students) whom will represent UQU at this year's NCCC competition. 

## Description

The repository is consisted of a Java project, which can be implemented (and solved) over several tasks. Each task can be either achieved on an individual basis, or by working as a group or a team (which is highly recommended).

The general aims are:

* To analyze a problem in an Object-Oriented manner, and then design and implement an Object-Oriented solution that conforms to given specifications.
* To practice file IO (input and output) in Java.
* To practice using abstraction and inheritance in Java.
* To practice using serialization in Java.
* To make implementations more robust through mechanisms such as exception
handling.

**Proposed solutions will be posted later, for reference.**

## Usage

You are to develop a program for certain space bodies, or rather, celestial objects (i.e. Stars, Planets and Moons)...

### Task One

TBA.

### Task Two
