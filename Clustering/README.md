## Third Task: Cluster Analysis

Here, you are to develop a Java program (using [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)) to solve the problem of Clustering (or grouping of data points)...

<!-- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the possibility of mimicking the basic functionality of a typical Standing Order System. In addition, the project is written in such a manner that demonstrates its effectiveness (using Unit Testing). -->

The general aims are:

* To solve the Clustering problem in an Object-Oriented manner, using the well-known [k-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm.
* To demonstrate the use of Vectors and Iterators in Java.
* To demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the Java Math API.

100 DataPoint objects (before).

4 Clusters (25 DataPoint objects each) after running the program.
