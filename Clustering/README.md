## Third Task: Cluster Analysis

Here, you are to develop a Java program (using [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)) to solve the problem of Clustering (or grouping of data points)...

<!-- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the possibility of mimicking the basic functionality of a typical Standing Order System. In addition, the project is written in such a manner that demonstrates its effectiveness (using Unit Testing). -->

The general aims are:

* To solve the Clustering problem in an Object-Oriented manner, using the well-known [k-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm.
* To demonstrate the use of Vectors and Iterators in Java.
* To demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the Java Math API.

### DataPoint

A [DataPoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_point)), in statistical terms, refers to a set of one or more measurements on a single member of a statistical population or grouping. It it [also be referred to](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/data-point) as is a discrete unit of information (that could be mapped and displayed using a system of geometry, e.g. X and Y in 2D).

### Example

100 DataPoint objects (before).

4 Clusters (25 DataPoint objects each) after running the program.
