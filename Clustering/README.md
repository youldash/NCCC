## Third Task: Cluster Analysis

Here, you are to develop a Java program (using [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)) to solve the problem of Clustering (i.e. grouping)...

<!-- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the possibility of mimicking the basic functionality of a typical Standing Order System. In addition, the project is written in such a manner that demonstrates its effectiveness (using Unit Testing). -->

The general aims are:

* To solve the Clustering problem in an Object-Oriented manner.
* To demonstrate the use of Vectors and Iterators in Java.
* To demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the Java Math API.
