## Second Task: Standing Orders

The following represents a complete and fully-implemented Java project, which can be used as a good educational reference.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the possibility of mimicking the basic functionality of a typical Standing Order System. In addition, the project is written in such a manner that demonstrates its effectiveness (using tested Use Cases).

The general aims are:

* To solve a typical, real-world problem in an Object-Oriented manner.
* To demonstrate the use of Enums, Abstraction and Inheritance in Java.
* To demonstrate the benefits of Exception Handling in Java.
* To demonstrate the benefits of running various tests (using predefined Use Cases) for developing robust, reliable projects.

### StandingOrderSystem Implementation

**Try creating a new Console-based application (and name it "StandingOrderSystemTester" e.g.) using [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/), import all Java files, and then run it.**

The outcome should confirm to the following (Console view):
