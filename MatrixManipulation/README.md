## Fourth Task: Matrix Manipulation

Here, you are to develop a Java program (using [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)) to perform a selected number of [Matrix transformations and calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) in Java.

In particular, you are expected to use the [sample code](https://raw.github.com/youldash/NCCC/master/MatrixManipulation/Matrices.java) (which is already written) to expand your knowledge in solving real-world applications and challenges that are related to problem domains like [Geometric Transformations (such as those performed in modern Computer Graphics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix), [Linear Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map), and others.

By the time you accomplish this task, you should be able to:

* Have a descent understanding of Matrices, and perform Matrix manipulation operations in an Object-Oriented manner.
* Demonstrate the use of Static Methods in Java.
* Demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the Java Math API.
* Parse data sets using new Java SDK libraries, such as Arrays, Files, Paths and more.
