# Asteroids

You are to write a Java program (using [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)) to solve the overlapping asteroids problem.

A complete specification to this challenge is presented [here](http://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/problems/icpc2015.pdf).

A solution to this challenge is posted in this directory.

Please note that **this is NOT the best and only solution**. As such, you may wish to optimize it, or rather, you may rewrite the whole thing from scratch :)
