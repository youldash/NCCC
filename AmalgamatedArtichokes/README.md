# Amalgamated Artichokes

## Outline

You are to write a Java program (using [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)) to determine the largest price decline over a given sequence of prices.

A complete specification to this challenge is presented [here](https://open.kattis.com/problems/artichoke).

A solution to this challenge is posted [here](https://github.com/youldash/NCCC/blob/master/solution/).

Please note that **this is NOT the best and only solution**. As such, you may wish to optimize it, or rather, you may rewrite the whole thing from scratch :)
